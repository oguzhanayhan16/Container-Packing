📦 Container Packing Algorithm with EB-AFIT & MCTS
This project addresses the container packing problem using EB-AFIT (Eager Best-Fit with Adaptive Fit Index Tuning) and MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) algorithms. The goal is to efficiently pack as many items as possible into a 3D container.

🚀 Features
📐 Advanced placement strategy (EB-AFIT)

🌲 Intelligent decision-making process (Monte Carlo Tree Search)

📦 3D box packing simulation

🔧 Configuration file support

📊 Performance metrics and visualization

🧠 Algorithms Used
EB-AFIT
EB-AFIT is an enhanced version of the classical Best-Fit algorithm. It performs optimized placements based on adaptive fit scores, ensuring better space utilization within the container.

MCTS
Monte Carlo Tree Search is used to probabilistically determine the most effective item placement sequence. It runs simulations at each step to explore potential outcomes and aims for optimal results.
